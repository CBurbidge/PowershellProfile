# PowershellProfile
This is my powershell $profile.

To install this as you profile 

- change the COMPUTERNAME in the AddFilesToProfile.
- open up a powershell console window, make sure the execution policy is appropriate.
- cd to where the files are and run the command `powershell -file .AddFilesToProfile.ps1`.

That should work, try again if it doesn't.

Write `editprofile` to bring up the profile in powershell_ise and type `list` to see the commands that are available.
